This is a simple little game where you (tactically) stack boxes. Stack as many boxes as you can without letting too many fall!

NOTE: In the Game window (that comes up when you press Play), change the resolution at the top of the window from "Free Aspect" to "960p".
Otherwise you may notice visual issues, as this game was designed for 4:3 aspect ratios.

When you press Play, you will see a box appear. You can manipulate the box with the following controls:

Left/Right Arrows -- Move box back and forth
Up/Down Arrows -- Rotate box
Space -- Drop box

These boxes are of random size and mass. You earn points if the box stays on the platform/structure without falling for more than 3 seconds.
Each box has a different "value" towards your score, which is based on physical attributes about the box and a hidden difficulty modifier.

All boxes are affected by physics, so it's important to consider the stability of your current structure when deciding where to drop the next box.
There's also a sliding platform that exists to make your life a little more difficult. It gets faster as your game goes on.

If a box falls into the void, you lose a life. You have 3 lives before the game ends. You can press "Play" again to restart the game.
