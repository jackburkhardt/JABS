# JABS
JABS was a homework assignment for Northwestern CS 376, made in rougly 3-4 days. Originally the title was TNAVN (Totally Not A Visual Novel) as a play on the rule in the assignment that we could not make visual novels. It sort of stopped making sense as a title after a while, so now it's called JABS (Just Another Box Stacker).

This is a simple little game where you (tactically) stack boxes. Stack as many boxes as you can without letting too many fall!

To download, see [Releases](https://github.com/jackburkhardt/JABS/releases).

## Instructions
When you press Play, you will see a box appear. You can manipulate the box with the following controls:

- Left/Right Arrows -- Move box back and forth
- Up/Down Arrows -- Rotate box
- Space -- Drop box

These boxes are of random size and mass. You earn points if the box stays on the platform/structure without falling for more than 3 seconds.
Each box has a different "value" towards your score, which is based on physical attributes about the box and a hidden difficulty modifier.

All boxes are affected by physics, so it's important to consider the stability of your current structure when deciding where to drop the next box.
There's also a sliding platform that exists to make your life a little more difficult. It gets faster as your game goes on.

If a box falls into the void, you lose a life. You have 3 lives before the game ends. You can press "Play" again to restart the game, or use the "Escape" key to quit the program.
